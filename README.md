# Exploration of causes of social media addiction

All functions for cleaning, exploring the data using linear regression plus scatter plots, and creating linear regression and structured model analysis models are located in functions.py.

The unit tests is located in 'testthings.py' and they are described in 'testsExplained.txt'.

The data analysis workflow is located in analysis.py.

All tables imported from third-party sources are located in the Datasets directory. All statistical tables processed through a combination of the datasets are located in Datasets/StatisticalTables.

Plots from third-party sources are located in the Plots directory. All custom plots are located within the directory Plots/Custom. Not all of these are used in the analysis, but many were used for exploration. 

Structured model analysis models are located in the directory Plots/Custom/Models. The model text files are *descriptions of the model*. The model image files are the visualisation of the models. The model(n)Test.csv files contain the independent, dependent variables, and their estimated regression relationship value, with standard errors, z-values and p-values.

The hypothesis model and alternative model used in the report are clearly labelled. The rest were experimental.
